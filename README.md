# LtiNrpsRails

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add lti_nrps_rails

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install lti_nrps_rails

## Usage

This engine is to implement as much as possible of the [LTI Names and Role Provisioning Services 2.0](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti-nrps/v2p0). The intent of this is to be a drop-in Rails engine to make building a LTI Names and Role Provisioning Services 2.0 application dead simple.

The need for this project stems from the [ims-lti](https://github.com/instructure/ims-lti) gem and the [lti_provider_engine](https://github.com/instructure/lti_provider_engine) engine. While those are decent starting points, they do not appear to implement the latest standards. This is a fresh implementation which will allow developers to use some or all relevant standards as needed.
